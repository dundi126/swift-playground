# Swift Playground

Welcome to **Swift Playground** – a personal learning space where I explore the fundamentals and capabilities of the Swift programming language. This project serves as a collection of hands-on exercises, experiments, and mini-projects built to understand Swift concepts from the ground up.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Learn the Swift programming language
- Understand iOS development fundamentals
- Practice with Swift Playgrounds and Xcode
- Build a foundation for future iOS/macOS app development
